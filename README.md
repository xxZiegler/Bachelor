# Bachelor Project:
## Exploring The effects of AI on an economy simulated with a solow-like model that has two types of labor forces $L_1$ and $L_2$:

The code that produces the paper's relevant figures, graphs, and data can be found in $\texttt{main.ipynb}$.

To run the Jupyter Notebook ($\texttt{ipynb}$) files, you can use the Jupyter Notebook application from a distribution like Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/) which is what I have done. Then you will need to execute the entire notebook and the graphs and figures will be displayed.
