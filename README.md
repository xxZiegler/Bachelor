# Bachelor Project:
## Exploring The effects of AI on an economy simulated with a solow-like model that has two types of labor forces $L_1$ and $L_2$:

The code that produces the paper's relevant figures, graphs, and data can be found in $\texttt{Final-Model.ipynb}$ It is a Python file that has various economy simulations under different conditions.  

## How to run
To run the Jupyter Notebook ($\texttt{ipynb}$) files, you can use the Jupyter Notebook application from a distribution like Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/) which is what I have done. Then you will need to clone the  repository and execute the entire notebook. then the graphs and figures will be displayed.

To make sure you have all the correct packages install the following;
1. Open a new cell in your Jupyter notebook.
2. Run the following commands in the cell:
```bash
!pip install numpy
!pip install sympy
!pip install pandas
!pip install matplotlib
!pip install ipywidgets
```
Or:
```bash
!pip install numpy sympy pandas matplotlib ipywidgets
```
Note that in some Jupyter environments, these packages might already be installed. In that case, the !pip install command will simply ensure that they are up to date.
