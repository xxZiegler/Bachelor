# Bachelor Project:
## Exploring The effects of AI on an economy simulated with a solow-like model that has two types of labor forces $L_1$ and $L_2$:

The code that produces the paper's relevant figures, graphs, and data can be found in $\texttt{Final$_$Model.ipynb}$.
It is a Python file that has various economy simulations under different conditions.  

$\big{**How to Run**}$
To run the Jupyter Notebook ($\texttt{ipynb}$) files, you can use the Jupyter Notebook application from a distribution like Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/) which is what I have done. Then you will need to execute the entire notebook and the graphs and figures will be displayed.

To make sure you have all the right packages install the following;
!pip install numpy
!pip install sympy
!pip install pandas
!pip install matplotlib
!pip install ipywidgets
