# Bachelor Project:
## Exploring The effects of AI on an economy simulated with a solow-like model that has two types of labor forces $L_1$ and $L_2$:

The code that produces the paper's relevant figures, graphs, and data can be found in $\texttt{Final-Model.ipynb}$ It is a Python file that has various economy simulations under different conditions.  

## Where to run the code
To run the Jupyter Notebook ($\texttt{ipynb}$) files, you can use the Jupyter Notebook application from a distribution like Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/) which is what I have done. Then you will need to clone the  repository and execute the entire notebook. Then the graphs and figures will be displayed.

## How to Run
To execute the simulations:

1. **Install Jupyter Notebook:**
   You can use the Jupyter Notebook application available in distributions like Anaconda as mentioned abouve. [Download Anaconda here](https://www.anaconda.com/).

2. **Clone the Repository:**
   Clone this repository to your local machine.

3. **Run the Notebook:**
   Open `Final-Model.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook and execute all cells to view the graphs and figures.

### Package Installation
Ensure the following packages are installed:
```bash
!pip install numpy
!pip install sympy
!pip install pandas
!pip install matplotlib
!pip install ipywidgets
```
Or:
```bash
!pip install numpy sympy pandas matplotlib ipywidgets
```
Note that in some Jupyter environments, these packages might already be installed. In that case, the !pip install command will simply ensure that they are up to date.
